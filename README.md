## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learnt how to change an image from mobile to desktop sizes using ID's and display none, display block.

I also used relative units like em and rem for responsive design instead of px.

I also practiced using variables again.

### Continued development

I still need to do lots of practice on responsiveness.
